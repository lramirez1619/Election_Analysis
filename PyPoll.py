# In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run:Â 
# 1. Total number of votes cast
# 2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
# 3. Total number of votes each candidate received
# 4. Percentage of votes each candidate won
# 5. The winner of the election based on popular vote

# dependencies and mac friendly.
import csv
import os

# Assign a variable for the file to load and the path.
file_to_load = os.path.join("Resources", "election_results.csv")

# Assign a variable to save the file to a path.
file_to_save = os.path.join("analysis", "election_analysis.txt")

# 1. Total number of votes cast
total_votes = 0

# Open the election results and read the file.
with open(file_to_load) as election_data:
    file_reader = csv.reader(election_data)

# Read the header row.
    headers = next(file_reader)
   
# Print each row in the CSV file.
    for row in file_reader:
        # 2. Add to the total vote count.
        total_votes += 1

# 3. Print the total votes.
